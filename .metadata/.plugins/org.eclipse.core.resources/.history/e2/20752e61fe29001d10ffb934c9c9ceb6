	 * Key Differences Between & and && 
	 * The & operator is a logical as well as a
	 * bitwise operator, as it operates on both booleans as well as binary data
	 * whereas, the && operator is only a logical operator as it operates only on a
	 * boolean data type. 
	 * The & operator evaluates both the side of the expression
	 * to obtain the final result whereas, the && operator evaluates only the left
	 * side of the expression & if turn out false it doesn’t even evaluate the right
	 * side of the expression.
